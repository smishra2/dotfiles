# Dotfiles (Sachit Mishra)

My bash dotfiles.


## How to install

This will overwrite any existing dotfiles you have, so back them up first! You can store user-specific configs in `~/.bash_profile.local`.

1. Clone into ~/.dotfiles

        $ git clone https://github.com/smishra2/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles


2. Execute dotfiles script

        $ ~/.dotfiles/bin/dotfiles

## Terminal color settings

You may want to consider using this with a theme or custom color settings on your terminal application.
